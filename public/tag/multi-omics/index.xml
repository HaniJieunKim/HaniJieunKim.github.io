      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) plays an essential role in mammalian biology and binds to both promoters and enhancers to catalyze the demethylation at H3K4 and H3K9. In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), LSD1 is well-known for its role in decommissioning enhancers during differentiation. In comparison, its role at the promoters of genes remains poorly understood in ESCs despite their widespread presence at these sites. Here, we report that LSD1 is associated with RNAPII pausing (RNAPII), a rate-limiting step in transcription regulation at the promoter-proximal region of genes, in mouse ESCs. Correlation of LSD1 binding sites against over 400 ChIP-seq datasets demonstrated a strong enrichment of factors involved in RNAP II pausing with LSD1. Previous studies have elucidated the coordinated actions of pausing and releasing factors that collectively modulate RNAPII pausing. In general, the involvement of chromatin remodellers in RNAPII pausing has not been well documented. We demonstrate that the knockdown of LSD1 preferentially affects genes with higher RNAPII pausing than those with lower pausing and, importantly, show that the co-localization of LSD1 and MYC, a factor known to regulate pause-release, is associated with the enrichment of other RNAPII pausing factors compared to their independent counterparts. Moreover, we found that genes co-occupied by LSD1 and MYC are significantly enriched for housekeeping genes that are involved in metabolic processes and globally depleted of transcription factors compared to those bound only by LSD1. These findings reveal a pleiotropic role of LSD1 in regulating housekeeping program besides its previously known role in regulating cell identity programs. Our integrative analysis presents evidence for a previously unanticipated role of LSD1 in RNAPII pausing through its association with pause release factors in modulating cell-type specific and cell-type invariant genes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The developmental potential of cells, termed pluripotency, is highly dynamic and progresses through a continuum of naive, formative and primed states. Pluripotency progression of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from naive to formative and primed state is governed by transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes. Genomic techniques have uncovered a multitude of TF binding sites in ESCs, yet a major challenge lies in identifying target genes from functional binding sites and reconstructing dynamic transcriptional networks underlying pluripotency progression. Here, we integrated time-resolved ‘trans-omic’ datasets together with TF binding profiles and chromatin conformation data to identify target genes of a panel of TFs. Our analyses revealed that naive TF target genes are more likely to be TFs themselves than those of formative TFs, suggesting denser hierarchies among naive TFs. We also discovered that formative TF target genes are marked by permissive epigenomic signatures in the naive state, indicating that they are poised for expression prior to the initiation of pluripotency transition to the formative state. Finally, our reconstructed transcriptional networks pinpointed the precise timing from naive to formative pluripotency progression and enabled the spatiotemporal mapping of differentiating ESCs to their in vivo counterparts in developing embryos.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS)-based phosphoproteomics has revolutionised our ability to profile phosphorylation-based signalling in cells and tissues on a global scale. To infer the action of kinases and signalling pathways in phosphoproteomic experiments, we present PhosR, a set of tools and methodologies implemented in a suite of R packages facilitating comprehensive analysis of phosphoproteomic data. By applying PhosR to both published and new phosphoproteomic datasets, we demonstrate capabilities in data imputation and normalisation using a novel set of ‘stably phosphorylated sites’,and in functional analysis for inferring active kinases and signalling pathways. In particular, we introduce a ‘signalome’ construction method for identifying a collection of signalling modules to summarise and visualise the interaction of kinases and their collective actions on signal transduction. Together, our data and findings demonstrate the utility of PhosR in processing and generating novel biological knowledge from MS-based phosphoproteomic data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-modal profiling of single cells represents one of the latest technological advancements in molecular biology. Among various single-cell multi-modal strategies, cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) allows simultaneous quantification of two distinct species: RNA and cell-surface proteins. Here, we introduce CiteFuse, a streamlined package consisting of a suite of tools for doublet detection, modality integration, clustering, differential RNA and protein expression analysis, antibody-derived tag evaluation, ligand–receptor interaction analysis and interactive web-based visualization of CITE-seq data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate the capacity of CiteFuse to integrate the two data modalities and its relative advantage against data generated from single-modality profiling using both simulations and real-world CITE-seq data. Furthermore, we illustrate a novel doublet detection method based on a combined index of cell hashing and transcriptome data. Finally, we demonstrate CiteFuse for predicting ligand–receptor interactions by using multi-modal CITE-seq data. Collectively, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of CiteFuse for the integrative analysis of transcriptome and epitope profiles from CITE-seq data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CiteFuse is freely available at &lt;a href=&#34;http://shiny.maths.usyd.edu.au/CiteFuse/&#34;&gt;http://shiny.maths.usyd.edu.au/CiteFuse/&lt;/a&gt; as an online web service and at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SydneyBioX/CiteFuse/&#34;&gt;https://github.com/SydneyBioX/CiteFuse/&lt;/a&gt; as an R package.&lt;/p&gt;
